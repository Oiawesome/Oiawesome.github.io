<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>So, yeah, an article/guide to other metagames in 6th gen, new, right? Anyways, this idea spawned off the fact that OMs are so diverse and unique that it can be quite troublesome understanding them and understanding how to play them (well). So that&rsquo;s what this guide is for, this guide will cover the rules, history, threat list, current metagame / environment and even sample teams and other features of every single XY Other Metagame by the time this is done for the singular purpose of getting people learning how to play these OMs, and how to play them well, below are the metagames that have been written up so far:</p>

<h2><a name="balancedhackmonsxy">Balanced Hackmons XY</a></h2>

<p>Rules<br>
Following in the tradition of the original Balanced Hackmons, (also commonly referred to as &lsquo;BH&rsquo; as a shortening of the 2 words in the name: B for Balanced and the H standing for Hackmons, hence, BH) BHXY is an experiment in the reduction of teambuilding restrictions. You can use any pokemon with any move with any item with 252 ev's in every stat.</p>

<p>The current banlist is as follows:<br>
- OHKO moves<br>
- Wonder Guard<br>
- Huge Power<br>
- Pure Power<br>
- Shadow Tag<br>
- Arena Trap<br>
- Parental Bond</p>

<h3>History of BHXY</h3>

<p>BH is a very diverse environment due to the large amount of viable and diverse things in the tier,and this has stayed true through from all the stages of BH.<br><h4>BHXY Stage 1: &ldquo;Welcome to Kalos!&rdquo;</h4><br>
Post Quote of the Stage(by Adrian Marin- aka one of BH&rsquo;s best stall players to touch the tier)-<br>
&ldquo;Ok, here are some great sets at the moment:</p>

<p>Yveltal @ Toxic Orb<br>
Ability: Magic Guard<br>
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Def / 252 SAtk / 252 SDef / 252 Spd<br>
Jolly Nature<br>
- Rapid Spin<br>
- Crunch<br>
- Brave Bird<br>
- Roost</p>

<p>Yveltal counters Nature Power users, spins well because of its SE crunch to rapid blockers such as Aegislash and Giratina, and it also has high bulk! 100 base speed tier also greatly aids it!</p>

<p>
Xerneas (F) @ Leftovers<br>
Ability: Unaware<br>
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 252 SAtk / 252 SDef / 252 Spd<br>
Calm Nature<br>
IVs: null Atk<br>
- Heal Order<br>
- Perish Song<br>
- Moon Blast<br>
- Foul Play</p>

<p>Xerneas is now the best Unaware in the metagame, because of its immunity to dragon, it walls Kyurem-W and Latios well, additionally, it hits very hard with Moon Blast and can speed tie with the 670 bst normal brothers.</p>

<p>
Carbink @ Leftovers<br>
Ability: Sand Stream<br>
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Def / 252 SAtk / 252 SDef<br>
Careful Nature<br>
IVs: null SAtk / 0 Spd<br>
- Magic Coat<br>
- Heal Order<br>
- Stealth Rock<br>
- Skill Swap</p>

<p>Carbink is quite an interesting pokemon, resisting both of Yveltal's STABS while countering Reshiram effectively. Magic Coat allows it to bounce back things that would threaten it such as Taunt, and Dark Void while Heal Order is standard for walls and Skill Swap + Stealth Rock pair nicely, use it on bouncers to set rocks or use it on Magic Guard Yveltal.</p>

<p>
Registeel V.2 (Aegislash) @ Leftovers<br>
Ability: Magic Bounce<br>
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Def / 252 SAtk / 252 SDef / 252 Spd<br>
Bold Nature<br>
- Entrainment<br>
- Heal Order<br>
- Whirlwind<br>
- Aromatherapy</p>

<p>Aegislash is overall, the best anti-Poison Heal Regigigas available, something all successful BH teams should have. Entrainment is standard on anti-gigas bounce users while Whirlwind can phaze a substitute'd Gigas, something that would really threaten your team since you can't Entrainment through Substitute. Aromatherapy and Heal Order are used for longevity and team support&rdquo;</p>

<p>To be perfectly honest, this was quite a unknowing and ignorant time due to all the off estimates of calculating new kalos poke stats, all the misconceptions of mechanics and general new-ness of the tier in XY Format. To explain: Zyarge was &ldquo;confirmed&rdquo; by serebii at the time to have 130/130/130 bulk and the XY twin legends were confirmed to have a 100 base speed tier and higher overall defenses, not only that but it was also unknown how powder immunities worked, so nobody was using bulky grasses like MegaSaur or Ferrothorn to absorb accurate sleep moves or anything, in fact, dark void was considered extremely inferior to spore in every way due to the lack of knowledge of powder moves in XY, leading to the use of magic bounce and toxic orb PH/Magic Guard quite a lot. Not only that but Nature Power was not yet learned to have switched from earthquake to tri attack, making people, like for example adrian marin paranoid of prankster NP spammers like Groudon. This era also features the fact that knock off wasn&rsquo;t known to have it&rsquo;s current effects in XY at this time so PH gira&rsquo;s only option for bounce aegis was a random surprise sacred fire and yveltal was still using the -now inferior- crunch!</p>

<p>Not only this, but refrigerate was only really just being discovered, and now it was only really being used for boomburst on kyurem-white, which it still is being used for, but kyurem-black was not really discovered, nor was parental bond, which we will come to talk about later. On the subject of ability changes, gale wings was getting a lot of note, mainly for being new but for showing great potential on Rayquaza, which could use moldy wall breakers &amp; other wall breakers to clean up unawares before a smash sweep, due to it having ridiculous level priority, once the unawares were stopped, it could easily clean many teams easily due to the lack of imposter spam early gen 6 unlike late gen 5 due to people wanting to try new things. </p>

&ldquo;&lsquo;Adrian Marin said: <br>
What I don't like is that it cannot defeat Imposter reliably and must rely on an anti-imposter such as Shedinja&rsquo;<br>
 <br>
Well I must say that yes, blocking Protean must be really hard, and easily countered by Imposter, which is where my standard Shedinja comes into play. It is very useful for blocking all kinds of sweepers, though it does require more maintenance than most team members.<br>
 <br>
&lsquo;TheBurgerKing99 said: <br>
So a set I enjoy is magic guard Ho-oh... with toxic orb... The ability to hit hard, get past shedinja (oh yeah, that's what psycho shift is for.)&rsquo;<br>
 <br>
As Burger has so nicely brought up, sets like this Ho-Oh would be difficult to defend, especially with the lack of any status absorbers on my team, save a grass type for spore. This gave rise to a unique set for my Shedinja, users of Dark Void/Spore, and my entire team in general: Prankster Safeguard. Originally I just ran it on my Shedinja for obvious reasons, then realized it is useful in other ways. I put Safeguard on my Prankster mon as well and, noticing Sheddy hasn't used it at all since then, replaced the move.</p>

<p>Completely off-topic from this post, but I firmly believe that Pure/Huge Power should be banned on PS. sugarhigh is running around with a Slaking that 1HKOs everything. Just putting that out there&rdquo; <br>
(3rd post by asterat(again) a well known BH player)<br>
&ldquo; &lsquo;Adrian Marin said: <br>
Fur Coat really isn't that great an ability, BH is all about walling top threats, and the most important physical top threat to stop is PH Gigas, which requires a Pokemon resistant to Facade and the ability to not care about sleep. Fur Coat only provides a x2 defense boost, it's not OP, it never will be and it will not balance out Pure/Huge Power's with boosting moves.&rsquo;<br>
 <br>
Playful countered gigas pretty effectively with fur coat chesnaught. No, it's not a perfect counter but fur coat in the right pace can be a very useful walling ability. But I do absolutely agree p/h power are broken and not kept in check by fur coat.</p>

<p>
Redless I was referring to the era where you started mega evolved.</p>

<p>
Also this made me sad:<br>
&deg;GymLdr.NonePiece&deg;:Bro, I've used Contrary Arceus Fire with V-Create<br>
&deg;GymLdr.NonePiece&deg;:Works epicly&rdquo; </p>

<p>This was a very interesting stage in BHXY to say the least. Not quite a real stage in itself, kind of mixed in with stage 1, but this was a great development in BH, seeing every play style trying to shift efficiently but eventually failing to due to the sheer power of PP/HP. Due to it&rsquo;s power, many people debated on why the hell we re tested it in the first place. The main users of it were Slaking and Regigigas with sets abusing knock off, return, and other filler moves due to their power and easy type coverage synergy between 2 moves. after a couple of ladder sessions, resetting of the pokemon showdown main server it was finally banned.</p>

<p><h4>BHXY Stage 3: &ldquo;Parental BANNED&rdquo;(The BH Parental Bond Voting thread: http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/bh-parental-bond-policy-decision.3494352 )</h4></p>

<p>Post Quote(s) of the Stage(1st post by &lsquo;Rumors&rsquo; a well known BH player)</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am in favor of an outright ban and here is why.</p>

<p>First, the elephant in the room: Seismic Shade Fang. Any Pokemon in the tier, and literally any Pokemon, including Weedle and Sunkern, can 2HKO any susceptible Pokemon with that move combination. Only Ghosts with greater than base 100 HP and Shedinja cannot be 2HKOed as Seismis Shade is a clean 2HKO on anything below base 100 HP. There's no reason something like Weedle should ever have the capability to 2HKO something like Lugia (FEAR aside).</p>

<p>Second, purely in terms of damage output, Parental Bond outclasses all other legal pure damage abilities. Adaptability boosts STABs by 50%. Technician boosts base 60 or less moves by 50%. Drought/Drizzle indirectly boost Fire/Water moves 50% via weather. Blaze/Torrent/Overgrowth/Swarm boost their types' moves by 50% but only when HP is 33%. Guts increases Attack by 50%, but only when statused. Flare Boost is the same for Special Moves and is limited to burns. Hustle boosts physical moves by 50%, but reduces accuracy by 20%. Solar Power boosts special moves by 50%, but only in the sun and also drains HP as quickly as the standard poison status. All other damage-boosting abilities are either below 50% or do not work in singles.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Parental Bond boosts damage by 50% for all moves all the time with no draw backs of any sort. Hence, if you want a damage boosting ability, there's little reason to run anything else. Refridge/Pixel/Aerilate, Prankster, and Moldy are about the only other viable options and even then only on specific Pokemon or sets, and offensive Moldy is kind of nerfed this generation with the lower reliance on Unaware.</p>

<p>The over-centralization it causes for just those two reasons alone would be enough to annoy me. But, there's more!</p>

<p>With Parental Bond, because the attack strikes twice, you're actually getting &quot;lite&quot; versions of other abilities. Serene Grace and Super Luck are the most prominent. You could also argue that you get Infiltrator-lite and Skill Link-lite, except the latter working on every move.</p>

<p>Basically, secondary and crit chance are increased by 25% over their normal values and the user can break through and damage Pokemon behind subs reliably. They also bust through the rare non-Sheddy Sturdy and Focus Sash.</p>

<p>There's also a lot of other shenanigans that haven't really been explored much but are out there. Off the top of my head...</p>

<p>Nuzzle to bypass Lum Berry, except for Harvest Lum.<br>
Power Up Punch for obvious reasons.<br>
Moves like Mystical Fire to neuter an attacker while hurting it.<br>
Moves like Low Sweep to gain a massive speed advantage. Low Sweep and the like usually does this already thanks to how narrow speed tiers are in BH, but with PB it can even gradually slow down a Speed Boost user.<br>
Let's not even mention moves like Mud Slap. >.><br>
PB Acid Spray pretty much forces out even the sturdiest of special walls.</p>

<p>While those are less directly threatening than the Seismic Shade Fang combo (which is really just stupidly effective), that kind of stuff could still be problematic and I imagine at least some of it would start showing up should Seismic Shade Fang get the ban. I don't know how broken those would be in practice, but it's worth considering.</p>

<p>Or they'll just start using Choice Band PB V-Create Mega Blaziken. I've used that before Seismic Shade Fang was discovered and it was just silly. At least my Adaptability Entei in Gen V only got the boost on STABs.</p>

<p>And finally, Parental Bond sets a bad example for our younger players. It encourages them to go out and have children simply to gain an advantage in battle. And I don't know about you, but anything that encourages the next generation to raise their own kids to be child soldiers has to be a bad thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As you can see, this was quite the problem in BH, Rumors&rsquo; post basically summed up how broken the ability was and could be. Parental Bond was quite the ability in BH as you could see, nukes could fire off 50% stronger hits, luck gimmicks could legitimately be viable for once with the boost in power, nuzzle could destroy lum berry, and sacred fire was a 142.5 BP move with a 75% chance to burn before STAB! and last but definitely, utterly not least in any way, shape, or form: Seismic-Fang-Shade: THe combination of Seismic Toss and/or Super Fang and Night Shade all in one combined with Parental Bond in order to always deal with any pokemon bar a ghost type with >100 base HP- with Super Fang dealing 75% to any non ghost type, Seismic toss dealing any non ghost for 200 HP exactly in order to combo with SFang to pick off any non ghost type and Night Shade which was basically another version of Seismic toss except it was used for hitting any ghost with over 100 base HP with it&rsquo;s 200 HP per round damage instead of picking off SFang&rsquo;s targets like Seismic did. Pretty much the only sure fire checks to this were Giratina and hoping to god you win the speed ties with Imposter, as everything else was eliminated, Shedinja could count as a minor check but double Sacred fire and sandstorm/hail to surprise sheddy were very common and could easily deal with it, lets just thank game freak they decided not to let this beast work with support moves.</p>

<p><h4>BHXY Stage 4: The Current Metagame Post Quote of the Stage(by Adrian Marin)</h4><br>
&ldquo;Metal Burst + Unaware was a very common sight last gen, especially with Chansey, it was used with:</p>

<p>Chansey (F) @ Eviolite<br>
Ability: Unaware<br>
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 252 SAtk / 252 SDef<br>
Relaxed Nature<br>
IVs: NaN Atk / NaN Spd<br>
- Metal Burst<br>
- Heal Order<br>
- Magic Coat<br>
- Perish Song</p>

<p>Unaware Chansey was easily one of the best Unawares last gen, Metal Burst did immense damage even by taking a little damage from the opposition.</p>

<p>However, I wouldn't suggest using it this gen, Knock Off, Poison Heal + Sleep and other strategies are just too common.</p>

<p>Also, this is my 300th post!&rdquo; <br>
So here we are, the final frontier, today&rsquo;s metagame. Alright so here&rsquo;s basically, today&rsquo;s metagame: Xerneas, Kyurem-W, Mega Gar, The Mega Mewtwos, Mega Ken and Kyurem-B and some others are top offensive threats - Chansey, Giratina, PH Yveltal, Mega Saur, Mega Scizor, Flash Fire Aegislash, Regen Kyogre and Cresselia are top defensive threats - and Shedinja, PH Gigas, Imposter Chans/Bliss and Yveltal are top utility threats.<br>
With all of these comes, explanations, Xerneas and the Kyurems use Pixilate and Refridgerate respectively to boost powerful normal spam attacks like Fake Out, Boomburst, Extremespeed along with coverage like Magma Storm, Volt Switch, Earthquake, Knock off, etc. and Utility moves like Spore and Roost. Mega Gar uses Spooky Plate Judgement sets to avoid imposter and also some Electrify sets to boost up through checks. Mega Mewtwos often are HEAVY hitters with Protean backing them up with the highest attacking stats in the game. Also Mega Ken uses powerful strong STAB V-Creates, fighting STABs and Knock Offs in order to powerhouse through most of the tier. These were mainly just examples. the rest will be in the BHXY Threatlist.</p>
