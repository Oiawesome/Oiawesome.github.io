<color="white"><b>Looking to play classic DPP without all the hassle of learning it from scratch AND finding matches?</b> Well then, welcome to <b>Project DPP</b> a fan mod based off of the source code of popular Pokemon Sim "Pokemon Showdown" modded and planned by independent developer Oiawesome with additional help from users such as Arhops and DreMZ from gaming website "Smogon".
<br><br>
<div class="header"><font size="28"></font><b>Well what is Project DPP? and how can I play it></b></div>
<p><b>Project DPP</b> is a modification to the Pokemon XY engine via Pokemon Showdown which sees XY as a flawed metagame that could be improved. Project DPP includes changes like: Modified stats, abilities and/or movepools for certain pokemon that help bring the feel of DPP back, revamped mechanics that merge playstyles from DPP and XY together and even whole new moves and abilities in some cases! Currently <b>Project DPP</b> is more of a thought experiment than a reality. There is a changelog for a possible beta .1 in the works, however the programming piece has not been finalized for the public. So in the near future there shall be a beta .1 on a custom server for your playing pleasure! This will of course, come packaged with a link to the (soon to be)changelog page on this very website!</p>
