<h2>CAP 18 Begins!</h2>
<div class="modified">Posted on <strong>Mar 3, 2014</strong></div>
<p>Led by Topic Leader, <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/members/detroitlolcat">DetroitLolcat</a>, Smogon's first XY Create a Pokemon project has officially begun!</p>

<p>CAP is a competitive-minded project whose aim is to learn more about the metagame and what goes into a successful competitive Pokemon by building them from the ground up. The process differs from most fake-mon projects in the way that it is competitively-focused, community-driven, and focuses on a concept to fulfill which is voted on at the start of each project. New users should take some time to get used to the forum and read up on the subject. Once they're feeling comfortable, they should <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/cap-18-part-1-concept-submissions.3501259/">submit a concept</a>! Who knows, they could have the winning one! </p>

<p>To read more about the CAP project's history, rules, and creations, check out the <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/encaplopedia-the-complete-reference-index-for-create-a-pokémon.48782/">EnCAPlopedia</a>, which is full of helpful links and references. ~darkie</p>

<h2>Kangaskhanite banned from OU</h2>	

<div class="modified">Posted on <strong>Dec 18, 2013</strong></div>
    <p>Kangaskhanite has been officially banned by the OU Tiering Council. A quick run-down of the reasoning, with more information in the linked thread, is as follows: </p>
     
    <ol>
    <li>Mega Kangaskhan, with an effective 213 base attack thanks to Parental Bond, is too powerful for even the bulkiest of OU physical walls. Damage calculations are listed in the thread.</li>
     
    <li>Mega Kangaskhan is nearly impossible to revenge kill outside of fast and powerful Fighting-types. Other Pokemon who outspeed are either OHKOed by a +2 Sucker Punch or too weak to break through its 105/100/100 defenses.</li>
     
    <li>Mega Kangaskhan severely limits teambuilding by forcing teams to run multiple obscure counters and checks.</li>
    </ol>
     
    <p>For more information, check out the <a href="/forums/threads/kangaskhanite-is-now-banned-to-ubers.3495351/">official announcement thread</a> which details exactly why Kangaskhanite is considered Uber at this time. Please note that this quickban is merely an extension of the initial banlist and may be reconsidered as the metagame develops. ~darkie</p>

<h2>Sixth Generation Pokemon Analysis Previews</h2>

<div class="modified">Posted on <strong>Dec 14, 2013</strong></div>

<p>As you may have noticed, Smogon is going through a bit of a transitional phase at the moment, which has delayed the Gen 6 StrategyDex. But that doesn't mean we haven't been hard at work creating a reference for everyone! Until we start rolling out our new analyses, you can use our <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/sixth-generation-pokemon-previews-index.3494918/">Pokemon Previews Index</a> to view information on Pokemon currently available in the Kalos Pokédex. As always, drop by the <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/forums/sixth-generation-contributions.253/">Sixth Generation Contributions &amp; Corrections</a> forum if you want to start helping us in the future! ~GatoDelFuego </p>

       <h2>Smogon Mentorship</h2>


<div class="modified">Posted on <strong>Dec 4, 2013</strong></div>
<p>With the still-recent release of Pokemon X and Y, many new users have begun
getting involved with our site! For our newer users, the huge amount of
subforums and places to post can be really intimidating. You might not even know
exactly what it is you want to get out of Smogon. A fantastic way to get
acquainted with our site is to check out our Mentorship Program, which has its
own <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/forums/mentorship-program.264/">subforum</a>,
as well as a thread where you can <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/introduce-yourself.3480294/">introduce
yourself</a>! If you're looking to talk one-on-one with some of our mentors, you
can hop on <a href="http://mibbit.com/#mentor@irc.synirc.net">#mentor, our SynIRC
channel</a> where you can chat real-time with plenty of Smogoners who have been
where you are now. You can also <a href="http://www.smogon.com/mentorship/profiles">read up about our mentors</a> and
see if there's anyone who specializes in a part of the site that you're
interested in. There's a lot of information here, but don't be afraid to jump in
and get your feet wet by asking questions. We're here to help! :) -Treecko</p>

       <h2>CAP 6 Playtest Cawmodore</h2>

<div class="modified">Posted on <strong>Nov 16, 2013</strong></div>
<p>The <b>Create-A-Pokémon</b> community would like to show off our newest creation: <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/cap-6-final-product.3492339/"><b>Cawmodore</b></a>! After 112 days chock full of discussions, submissions, and voting phases, we've come a conclusion within the past few days. Although the final stages of the process were diverted due to the release of Pokémon X and Y, we managed to persevere and complete the project. Cawmodore is a Steel / Flying Pok&amp;eacute;mon that's designed to utilize underused moves. In our initial discussions, we decided as a community that we wanted to focus specifically on the risk and reward aspects of Belly Drum. You'll notice that we considered this move at every stage in our process, from selecting Intimidate as its competitive ability to its blazing base Speed of 118.</p>

<p>Now that we've completed our new Pokémon, it's time for the official CAP 6 <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/cap-6-playtest.3492739/">playtest</a> to begin! The ladder is limited to a two week period where competitive Pokémon battlers will play in a metagame consisting of BW2 Overused Pokémon plus Cawmodore. This isolated test will determine how well Cawmodore held to its original concept. Is Belly Drum viable in the fifth generation of Pokémon? Help us find out by battling on this playtest ladder whenever you get the chance. If you like to experiment and battle in a fun, creative, and combative environment in OU with an <b>entirely new competitive Pokémon</b>, check out <a href="http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/lobby">Pokémon Showdown!</a> to see what the fuss is all about.</p>

<p>If you're interested in the Create-A-Pokémon Project, check out the <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=66">CAP forum</a>, where we're running a variety of side projects. We still have to decide on Cawmodore's third ability and Pokédex entries, so jump in to discuss and vote. Scope out the <a href="http://www.smogon.com/cap/">CAP sub-site</a> if you're looking to discover more information on CAP. As we close out the fifth generation of Pokemon creation, I'd like to personally thank all of our fans and supporters. The community is what makes this project such a massive success! Have patience with the Policy Review Committee as we re-work the project for the sixth generation. See you on the other end! ~Birkal</p>
				
	

   <h2>Battle Spot</h2>
     
<div class="modified">Posted on <strong>Nov 14, 2013</strong></div>
    <p>X and Y have arrived, and so has the new in-game Battle Spot, a WiFi ladder you can play on your 3DS. With all of the new innovations of generation six, it has become more simple than ever to breed and train your own Pokemon. By playing Battle Spot, you use your own Pokemon that you put loads of effort into raising and pit them against opponents from across the world. To learn more about the metagame or to discuss the trends you've seen while playing, check out our new Battle Spot subforum <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/forums/the-battle-spot.265/">here</a>! You talk to other Battle Spot fans in real-time by going to #battlespot on SynIRC or by following this handy <a href="http://client00.chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.synirc.net&amp;channel=%23battlespot">Mibbit link</a> Hope to see you playing! -Treecko</p>
