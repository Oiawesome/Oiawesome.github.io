    <h1>Kalos 2 OU Threat List</h1>

<div class="author">By <a href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/members/oiawesomedg.191842/">Oiawesome</a> and various contributors.</div>

<p><img src="http://www.serebii.net/xy/pokemon/681.png" alt="Aegislash"><br>
<strong>Aegislash</strong><br>
Base Stats:[Sheild Forme]: 85 HP / 55 Atk / 140 Def / 55 SpA / 90 SpD / 55 Spe
[Blade Forme]: 65 HP / 125 Atk / 55 Def / 125 SpA / 55 SpD / 100 Spe<br>
Abilities: Stance Change</p>

<p>Aegislash is both helped and hurt by the changes made in Kalos 2. The pure ghost typing actually lets it pivot into more threatening attackers in the tier like Garchomp and, with it's new Will-o-Wisp, neuter them although  it makes it so that it cannot have the precious resistances that come along with the old Steel typing. Aegislash also gets 2 new useful moves in Kalos 2: The aforementioned Will-o-Wisp and also Secret Sword! Secret Sword lets a pure special based variant of Aegislash exist that is very threatening in it's own right. Aegislash now can serve as the aforementioned wall or pivot or it can go with an Swords Dance Phantom Force set which can be quite devastating late game and even some special or mixed sets! Simply Aegislash's new pure Ghost Typing, movepool, physical ghost STAB, speed tier and bulk help it be very effective in the current metagame of Kalos 2 OU.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/334.png" alt="Altaria"><br>
<a href="/bw/pokemon/altaria"><strong>Altaria</strong></a><br>
Base Stats: 75 HP / 70 Atk / 90 Def / 70 SpA / 105 SpD / 80 Spe<br>
Abilities: Natural Cure / Cloud Nine</p>

<p>As NU's only fully evolved Dragon-type, Altaria is a fairly unique Pokemon. Solid 75 / 90 / 105 defenses coupled with key resistances to common attacking types, such as Water and Fire, allows her to wall threats such as Swords Dance Samurott. In addition to this, Altaria has access to a decent support movepool filled with gems, such as Heal Bell, Roar, and Perish Song. Offensively, Altaria can utilize Dragon Dance in combination with Outrage and Earthquake in order to gain near perfect coverage. Choice Specs, the most common set, can be used to serve as a wallbreaker, allowing Altaria to dismantle common checks such as Tangela.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/181.png" alt="Ampharos"><br>
<a href="/bw/pokemon/ampharos"><strong>Ampharos</strong></a><br>
Base Stats: 90 HP / 75 Atk / 75 Def / 115 SpA / 90 SpD / 55 Spe<br>
Abilities: Static / Plus</p>

<p>Ampharos is one of the more interesting Electric-types in NU. It doesn't fill a defensive role, and generally doesn't fulfill an offensive one either. Ampharos is a support Pokemon; it uses a combination of Heal Bell, respectable bulk, and Volt Switch to cure the team of status and work as a pivot for more balanced teams. Ampharos has the stats to run either a physical or special defensive set, although the physically defensive Ampharos is more common to take advantage of Ampharos's handy ability Static. A physically defensive set allows Ampharos to tank a myriad of attacks and serves as an interesting switch-in to offensive threats such as Kangaskhan. A specially defensive set is still viable as Ampharos has more natural Special Defense to begin with, but doesn't wall as much as the metagame as the physically inclined variant. Ampharos also has the ability to become a sweeper with Agility, but will struggle to sweep a team that has not been weakened substantially. Ampharos also has the ability to use Choice Specs quite well, although it is slow and struggles against common threats such as Golurk.</p>

<p><img src="/download/sprites/bw/664.png" alt="Zweilous"><br>
<a href="/bw/pokemon/zweilous"><strong>Zweilous</strong></a><br>
Base Stats: 72 HP / 85 Atk / 70 Def / 65 SpA / 70 SpD / 58 Spe<br>
Ability: Hustle</p>

<p>Zweilous is one most powerful Dragon-type Pokemon in the game, thanks to Hustle boosting its Attack to a near godly level. Its Outrage, which is backed by a base 152 Attack factoring in Hustle, is second only to Kyurem-B. Paired with Eviolite, Zweilous is a nuke on wheels. Nothing can stand to the power of Outrage, only the bulkiest of Pokemon can hope to stand to this Dark Dragon and not be utterly crippled. Zweilous can also utilize its secondary Dark-type STAB with Crunch, devastating Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon. For coverage, Zweilous can burn Steel-types, which are the only Pokemon capable of withstanding an Outrage, with Fire Fang. Switching out from Zweilous isn't a good idea either, because then it has the chance to set up a Substitute, which will make stopping the Dragon even harder. Zweilous can also shuffle the opposing team around with a STAB-boosted Dragon Tail. All this power does come at a cost, if Lady Luck is not on Zweilous's side, then it cannot hit the opponent, because of Hustle's side effect.</p>
